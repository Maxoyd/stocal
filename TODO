- deprecate Process.trajectory->(trans) over Process.sample->(time,state,transitions)
- deprecate ReactionRule -> TransitionRule
- deprecate pylint invalid arguments
- make sure that examples and tutorial tests pass without Deprecation warning
= feature/deprecations
* stocal.algorithms.AndersonMethod is broken
* stocal.experimental.samplers do not chain properly where invoking self.propose_potential_transition, etc.
* allow species equals 0 in initial state?
+ support for proper delay events (-> feature/events)
