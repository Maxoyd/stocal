- describe validation in docs/developer.md
- unittest for validation
- better report generation
- timeouts or max steps for sampling processes?
- update CHANGELOG
=
* TrajectorySampler.__iter__ seems to stop at tmax even if more events would occur then
* stocal.algorithms.AndersonNRM might be invalid/broken
* error in stocal.experimental.samplers: Samplers do not chain properly where invoking self.propose_potential_transition, etc.
* Event.__repr__ does not show full init signature
* allow species=0 in initial state?
- deprecate Process.trajectory->(trans) over Process.sample->(time,state,transitions)
- support for proper delay events
- tau leaping
- statistical verification tests
- utilities to simplify scipy/matplotlib interaction
- arithmetic operations for Process
- string rewrite rule support
- other kinetic laws, e.g. Hill function
- libSBML integration
- curried reactions (determine products only upon application)
- C/C++/D implementation
= version 1.2+
- remove dict support in MassAction.reactions and ReactionRule.infer_transitions
- remove invalid-name arguments
= version 2
