- FilteredSampler for rules
- random seed as TrajectorySampler argument
- neat Process.sample interface: Process.sample(state, tstart, tmax, steps, every, seed)
- deprecate optional TrajectorySampler arguments
- deprecate Process.trajectory
- move samplers into stocal.experimental and undo deprecations
- documentation
= feature/sampling
* Events fire even if their reactants are not present!!!
* stocal/examples/typed_rules.py does not do what it claims to do
- utilities to simplify scipy/matplotlib interaction
- string rewrite rule support
- support for proper delay events
- libSBML integration
- statistical verification tests
- curried reactions (determine products only upon application)
- other kinetic laws, e.g. Hill function
- SSA profiling and algorithm variations
- C/C++/D implementation
= version 1.2+
- deprecate dict support in MassAction.reactions and ReactionRule.infer_transitions
- deprecate invalid-name arguments
= version 2


Samplers
--------
Sampler.every() currently accepts steps or time arguments.
Sampler.average() follows the same pattern, but with different output.
Sampler.filter() is planned to behave like Sampler.every with different stepping criterion

Could filter instead be done as argument as well? To be able to do things like:
	Sampler.until(fires=[...])
	Sampler.every(fires=[...])
	Sampler.average(fires=[...])

In general, I want to
- sample until a certain stop criterion is reached
- step through the trajectory in flexible ways
- aggregate the trajectory data for each step
- yield aggregated summary information
