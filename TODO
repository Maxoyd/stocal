- validation for varying epsilon
- update CHANGELOG and tutorial

+ support for proper delay events
* TrajectorySampler.__iter__ seems to stop at tmax even if more events could occur
* stocal.algorithms.AndersonNRM is broken
* stocal.experimental.samplers do not chain properly where invoking self.propose_potential_transition, etc.
* Event.__repr__ does not show full init signature
* allow species equals 0 in initial state?
- deprecate Process.trajectory->(trans) over Process.sample->(time,state,transitions)
- deprecate AndersonNRM -> AndersonMethod
- deprecate ReactionRule -> TransitionRule
- deprecate pylint invalid arguments
- make sure that examples and tutorial tests pass without Deprecation warning
= release/1.2
- remove dict support in MassAction.reactions and ReactionRule.infer_transitions
- remove invalid-name arguments
- remove Process.trajectory->(trans) over Process.sample->(time,state,transitions)
- regroup tests into specifications, unittests and bugs
= release/2.0
- tau leaping
- utilities to simplify scipy/matplotlib interaction
- arithmetic operations for Process
- string rewrite rule support
- other kinetic laws, e.g. Hill function
